In this final installment of this guide, we'll be setting up a superior alternative to PulseAudio using PipeWire and WirePlumber on Artix Linux. This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration steps to achieve a fully functional sound system without the need for systemd or elogind.

***

## Packages

We're going to install these packages
```sh
doas pacman -S pipewire pipewire-dinit wireplumber wireplumber-dinit pipewire-alsa pipewire-jack
```

Once installed, let's enable our 2 user services with dinit (**DON'T** run them as **ROOT**). If you haven't setup the user services yet with dbus, follow my previous posts of this guide.
```sh
dinitctl enable pipewire
dinitctl enable wireplumber
```

### Handle the lack of systemd and elogind

We need to disable some configs to support our systemd and elogind free system.
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/wireplumber/{bluetooth.lua.d,main.lua.d}
touch ~/.config/wireplumber/bluetooth.lua.d/80-disable-logind.lua
```

Then edit `80-disable-logind.lua` and add
```lua
-- Disable arbitration of user allowance of bluetooth via D-Bus user session
bluez_monitor.properties["with-logind"] = false
```

And create `~/.config/wireplumber/main.lua.d/80-disable-dbus.lua` with
```lua
-- Disable use of flatpak portal integration
default_access.properties["enable-flatpak-portal"] = false
```

Exit your session and login. You should see all the services running using `dinitctl list`. If all the services are up and running, you should now have sound on your system!

<br />
## Usefull commands

You can check all your sources and more using
```sh
wpctl status
```

You'll maybe want to change your default sink (input), you can do so using
```sh
wpctl set-default ID
```

To get your current volume, run
```sh
wpctl get-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@
```

## Media support

To be able to pause a media and more, we're going to install the `playerctl` package in the `extra` Arch Linux repository. If you don't have setup this repository yet, follow [this](https://github.com/Sawangg/dotfiles/wiki/Manage-your-packages#arch-repositories).
```sh
doas pacman -S playerctl
```

Now you're able to use the `playerctl` commands such the pause command to pause the audio currently playing.
```sh
playerctl pause
```

## Last words
