Hosting your own services and applications in your homelab can become challenging, especially if you have non technical people 
using them. If you want your services to be easily manageable and up 24/7, you've come to the right place! In this
article, I'll guide you to run your own Kubernetes cluster by simply executing an Ansible playbook!

***

## Prerequisites
To be able to follow along, you'll need a few things
- The server or servers with any Linux Distro. This can be a Raspberry Pi with an ARM processor or any other x86 machine
- An internet connection

Additionally, if you want to install a Linux from scratch, you'll also need a storage device such as an USB stick
or SD card.

***

## Prepare your local machine

> I'm using `Artix Linux` and `opendoas` locally for the next few commands. You can change them to your own
> package manager and `sudo`.
<br/>
I created a [Github repository](https://github.com/Sawangg/dotfiles-server/) with all you'll need already configured.
This Kubernetes cluster uses internally `MetalLB`, `kubevip` and `flannel`. Clone it locally by running
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sawangg/dotfiles-server.git
```

### Ansible
First, we'll install `ansible` locally using our package manager
```sh
doas pacman -S ansible-core sshpass
ansible --version
```
Next, we're going to install `netaddr` on our machine. You can install via pip or your package manager
```sh
doas pacman -S python-netaddr
```
Finally, we'll need to install the required collections by running
```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install -r ./dotfiles-server/requirements.yml
```

### Kubectl
We're also going to install `kubectl` locally to interact with our cluster. You can build it from source, use your package manager or use the `AUR` like so if you're on an Arch based distro
```sh
yay -S kubectl kubecolor
```

### Optional: Flash your ISO/IMG
If you need to install a Linux from scratch on your server, it's time to pull out your USB stick / SD card. We're going
to install `Void Linux` because of the lightweight nature of this distro. For this example I'm using an ARM processor,
so I download the [Void ARM image](https://voidlinux.org/download/#arm%20platforms) and extracted it using 
```sh
xz -d <filename>
```

Next, you want to use and run this command to flash it onto the SD card or any other storage
```sh
doas dd if=<image>.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

> Replace `sdX` with the correct disk name. You can get it by running `lsblk`
<br />

Once it's done, you should resize the root partition using `fdisk` to use the available space.
```sh
doas fdisk /dev/sdX # Press E then select the root partition then ENTER then W
doas resize2fs /dev/sdXproot # Make sure to select the root partition
```

You can then plug everything and start your machine.

***

## Prepare your servers
If you already have a Linux up and running, you can skip to the last step named "Install Ansible dependencies". If you
installed Void Linux, continue to the next step.

<br />
### Login to Void Linux
Connect to the machine using SSH. The default username and password for the root account of Void Linux is `root:voidlinux`.  
First, we'll configure the timezone
```sh
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<timezone> /etc/localtime
```
Then, we'll start chrony to get the correct date
```sh
ln -s /etc/sv/chronyd /var/service/
sv start chronyd
date
```

#### Optional: Update your DNS
Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` with your desired DNS and prevent the DNS from being edited by running
```sh
chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
```

### Update the system
The system packages are probably outdated, run the following to update everything on your system
```sh
xbps-install -Su
```

### Create a new user account
You'll need to create a non root user account. Keep in mind that this username is going to be used by the Ansible playbooks.
```sh
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash <new_user>
passwd <new_user>
```

#### Optional: Replace `sudo` with `doas`
Because I'm not a fan of `sudo`, you can replace it with `opendoas`
```sh
xbps-install opendoas
echo "permit keepenv :wheel" > /etc/doas.conf
echo "ignorepkg=sudo" > /etc/xbps.d/10-ignore.conf
xbps-remove sudo
```

### Restart SSH
For some reasons, you'll have to restart the SSH service to prevent a key exchange error
```sh
sv restart sshd
```

### Install Ansible dependencies
To run our our Ansible playbooks, we need to install the managed node requirements. Connect to the server in SSH and
install `python3` and `pip` on your server. For example, here is the command for Void Linux
```sh
doas xbps-install python3 python3-pip
```

***

## Deploy your Kubernetes cluster
Now that both your servers and local machine are ready, you just have to configure 3 files to match your local network.
First, edit the `hosts.ini` file in the root of my Github repository with your local servers IPs.

<br/>
> Tip: You can use a tool like `nmap` to scan your local network for IPs
<br />

Finally, edit both the `global_vars.yml` and `K3s/vars.yml`. I provided documentation in each of them for easier
understanding of each configuration options.

Once you're set, run the following command to execute your Ansible playbook
```sh
ansible-playbook -k -K -e @global_vars.yml -e @K3s/vars.yml -i hosts.ini K3s/playbook-site.yml
```

> Tip: You can remove `-k -K` if you don't have any SSH password
<br />

If all went well, you should now have a Kubernetes cluster with everything setup correctly!

***

## Connect to your cluster
On your local machine, run the following
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.kube
scp user@your-server-ip:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
kubectl get nodes
```

If you get an output with all the nodes running, congratulations! You're now ready to deploy any services in Kubernetes!
