Hey there!
<br />
As a long-time TailwindCSS user and blog lurker, stumbling upon the job offer at Tailwind was akin to finding a hidden treasure. The idea of contributing to the development of tools that have been integral to my own projects is exciting to say the least. So today, I’m here to share my journey and express my keen interest in the Staff Software Engineer position at Tailwind Labs.
