Hey there!
<br />
As a long-time TailwindCSS user and blog lurker, stumbling upon the job offer at Tailwind was akin to finding hidden treasure. The idea of contributing to the development of tools that have been integral to my own projects is exciting, to say the least. So today, I’m here to share my journey and express my keen interest in the Staff Software Engineer position at Tailwind Labs.
<br />
I’m particularly drawn to the challenge of maintaining engineering standards while ensuring top-notch code quality and performance. Tailwind Labs’ commitment to delivering work we can be proud of resonates deeply with me, and I’m eager to contribute to this mission.
<br/>
Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to work on diverse and impactful projects. At my previous company, I led the development and deployment of a multitude of different projects by joining a small and innovative team much like Tailwind Labs. A few projects stood out to me, from a VSCode extension to a fully automated web assistant for the company. These experiences have equipped me with the leadership skills and technical expertise necessary to thrive in a dynamic environment (except if I’m missing coffee).
<br />
I’m proud to have contributed to projects aligned with Tailwind Labs' work. One notable contribution includes my work on [HeraUI](https://github.com/Sawangg/heraUI), a UI library based on [react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) and Tailwind that I'm creating. In fact, you're looking right at it; this blog is built with it! It is fully open-source and is heavily inspired by the widely popular shadcn/ui. It currently is in its early stage and I plan to expand it in the future!
<br />
Finally you can find my full resume [here](/resume.pdf) and browse through my blog to see what I'm up to.
<br />
Hope to hear from you guys at Tailwind!
