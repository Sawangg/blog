We need to configure our user environment to be able to run graphical apps and more. Because we're not using either systemd or logind, it will be harder but if you follow this guide, you'll have all the necessary tools to properly manager your sessions, seats and dbus!

***

## Seat tracker

We previously installed seatd in the introduction, you just need to add your current user to those groups
```sh
doas usermod -aG seat,video,audio,input $(whoami)
```

_You can check you groups using the `groups` command._
<br />
Enable the service as **ROOT** and start it if necessary
```sh
doas dinitctl enable seatd
```

We now have proper seat support. During your use of the system, you might install elogind as a dependency. You can forcefully remove it by running
```sh
doas pacman -Rdd elogind
```

***

## Dinit user services

Now that we have a seat tracker, we need a login tracker, that's where. Execute the following commands
```sh
doas pacman -S turnstile turnstile-dinit pambase-turnstile
```

Make sure you have this line in `/etc/pam.d/system-login` if it wasn't added automatically at the end of the file
```sh
session    optional    pam_turnstile.so
```

Once you're sure that the line was added, open `/etc/turnstile/turnstiled.conf` and change the value of `manage_rundir` from `no` to `yes`

Next enable the service **AS ROOT** and start it if necessary
```sh
doas dinitctl enable turnstiled
```

Exit your current session and log back in. You can now use `dinitctl list` as a non-root user. If you want to add your user services, place them in `~/.config/dinit.d/` and symlink to `~/.config/dinit.d/boot.d` if you want to start them when you log in.

***

## Dbus as a user

Because we're not using elogind, we don't have proper user dbus support. We're going to install a package that does that for us
```sh
doas pacman -S dbus-dinit-user
```

This service will now start when another service like `pipewire` requires a dbus session.
<br />
You now have correctly setup your user environment like a champ! You're ready for the next step which is a graphical interface in the next article!
